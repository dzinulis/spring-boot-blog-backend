# spring-boot-blog-backend


The goal of this project is to practice using Spring Boot by building a simple back end for a blog with the following basic features:

- creating new posts
- editing old posts
- deleting old posts
- changing visibility of posts

The content in the posts should be able to contain

- text
- pictures
- tables
- references

After creating basic functionality, a separate repository will be created for the front end.
